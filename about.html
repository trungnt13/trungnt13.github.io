            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            
            <p>I'm Trung Ngo, a researcher and technologist passionate about using technology to solve meaningful problems and improve people's lives. This blog is where I share my thoughts, discoveries, and reflections on the technologies and ideas that shape our world.</p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            
            <p>My work spans across several areas of technology and research:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning & AI:</strong> Exploring how intelligent systems can be designed ethically and deployed responsibly</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Computer Interaction:</strong> Understanding how people interact with technology and designing better experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Information Systems:</strong> Building systems that promote transparency, accessibility, and informed decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Research & Development:</strong> Contributing to the advancement of knowledge through rigorous research</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>

            <p>I believe that technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. The best solutions come from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human needs they're meant to address. This means:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Prioritizing ethics and social impact in technological development</li>
                <li>Creating accessible and inclusive systems that work for everyone</li>
                <li>Fostering open dialogue about the implications of our technological choices</li>
                <li>Continuous learning and adaptation in a rapidly changing field</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Beyond Work</h2>

            <p>When I'm not working on research or writing code, you can find me reading about philosophy and history, exploring new places, or engaging in discussions about how we can build a better future through thoughtful application of technology.</p>

            <h2>Let's Connect</h2>

            <p>I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, technologists, and anyone curious about the intersection of technology and society. Whether you have questions about my work, want to discuss an idea, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out!</p>
